# UI/UX Prototype Designing 

Implementation of good looking interface that people now like to use, in lieu of some other similar utility. Ok done, great going !!

About the mid-evaluation phase for woc3.0, the implementation of UI/UX design for an e-commerce homepage is purely fictional; The brand name, symbols, utilities and functions are applied, prepared and compiled for the cause of good interface design purpose only, and not to copy preexisting designs having same or similar resemblance. There's no intention to steal, change or implement the original work. The design here implemented is solely for skill enhancement and learning purpose.
